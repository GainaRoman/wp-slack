By default, there are two events that can be sent to Slack:

1. When a post is published
1. When there's a new comment

It's possible to add more events using `slack_get_events` filter. For more information check [the doc](http://gedex.web.id/wp-slack/).

**Development of this plugin is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/gedex/wp-slack). Pull requests are always welcome**.
